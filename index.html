                <p>
                    I am a very passionate person, over the past couple of years, I’ve dabbled in many areas of life such as sports, music, and tech to name a few. More recently, however, someone piqued my interest, and that’s you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Truth be told, I wanted us to get close in a way like friends do from the start. I never really expected my feelings to grow, reaching a point where it’s currently 10:28 PM as I’m making this letter, and I’m also really nervous as I anxiously triple-check every word that I write.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before I forget to introduce myself,
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hi! It’s me, Kurt. I can only imagine what your reaction will be after reading that. I’m not sure if you’re surprised, but I’m willing to bet that it’s likely that you are. I mean I’m always walking on eggshells when I’m around you. This leads to us having the most awkward conversations ever t_t…
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the reasons why I’ve developed feelings for you was your smile. It’s hard to explain, but yours is very warm. Throughout my life, I’ve only felt warm smiles from a couple of people. Medyo vague siya yes, and I can explain it better, but I don’t want to bore you with all those details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also hindi rin maayos ung transitions from paragraphs to paragraphs (medyo sabog na, maam cd kasi eh.) I don’t want to force my feelings onto you, I totally understand, and respect if you can’t reciprocate them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After this letter, I know things will change between us, for better or for worse. I’m risking it all because it’s you, and to me, you’re worth that risk.
                </p>
